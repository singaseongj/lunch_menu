# Agent Guidelines

- Preserve the Korean copy used in the UI when updating markup or scripts; new text should remain in Korean unless otherwise requested.
- Whenever `menu.js` is modified, also update the built artifact by running `npm run build:menu` so `dist/menu.js` stays in sync.
- If you change how menu data is produced, document the workflow in the README and update any affected npm scripts.
